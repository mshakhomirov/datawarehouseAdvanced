Prerequisites and Resources


# Prerequisites
This project is for learners who would like to choose a data engineer or developer career path and already have some experience working with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and would like to learn Data Engineering basics by implementing their own data extraction pipeline in the cloud.

* TOOLS (with detailed descriptions, if applicable)
   * Google Cloud BigQuery
   * Dataform
   * Basic understanding of cloud computing (Amazon Web Services, GCP)
   * Shell (Command line interface) commands and scripting (Advanced).
   * Node.js installed on your machine.
   * Node package manager installed.
   * Basic knowledge of serverless infrastructure, i.e. AWS Lambda.
   * Experience with `aws-sdk` libraries.
   * AWS CLI (AWS Command Line Interface) installed.


* TECHNIQUES (with detailed descriptions, if applicable)
   * Good knowledge of SQL, i.e. MySQL database.
   * Understanding of REST APIs.
   * Good knowledge of `Node.JS` (intermediate). You will create a Lambda Function. 
        * You must understand `Node.JS` basic concepts, i.e. `async` funcitons, `Node packages` and how the code works.
        * basic debugging (consoles, print statements)
        * loops: i.e. `for`
        * branches: if, if/else, switches
   * Shell commands and scripting as you would want to deploy you Lambda using `AWS CLI` from command line. Final solution will contain a Shell script for those users who are familiar with scripting. Each line will be explained in order to demonstrate how to use shell commands in the script.

Enthusiasm for solving problems and self-led learning will also prove quite useful (and not just in this project)!
